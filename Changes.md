## 0.48 2017-04-25
- Rewrite of the Parser to use Pod::Simple::XHTML internally instead of legacy Pod::Parser. This fixes some issues with linking and adds proper encoding support based on the Pod command `=encoding`.

- Support for function source code embedding was removed in order to focus on proper Pod rendering instead.

- Fixed JSON output to generate stable structures that can be added to version control
  systems without changing all the time.
- Generate Perl package documentation with proper :: separators in package name.
- Ignore files which don't contain POD.

- applyed a great patch from Ankur Gupta.
